Split parameters can be combined to split on multiple criteria.\n\n`MOTIONSPLIT` can split on :\n- stopped state detection\n- moving to stopped transition \n- time difference between two ticks (just as [`TIMESPLIT`](/doc/TIMESPLIT) does).\n- maximal distance between two consecutive positions.\n\n`MOTIONSPLIT` parameters:\n- **timesplit**: LONG value, time in platform time unit. Splits if the time difference between two consecutive ticks is strictly greater than this parameter. If defined, the split type label will be \"timesplit\".\n- **distance.split**: DOUBLE value, distance in meter. Splits if the orthodromic distance between two consecutive locations is strictly greater than this parameter. If defined, the split type label will be \"distancesplit\".\n- **stopped.min.time**: LONG value, time in platform time unit. This is the minimum time the consecutive locations should stay in the stopped zone radius to consider a stop state. If defined, the split type label will be \"stopped\".\n- **stopped.max.radius**: DOUBLE value, distance in meter. As long as consecutive positions remains in the radius during stopped.min.time, `MOTIONSPLIT` detect a stopped state.\n- **stopped.max.speed**: DOUBLE value, speed in m/s. If the speed is greater than this value while in stopped state, `MOTIONSPLIT` exits the stopped state.\n- **stopped.max.mean.speed**: DOUBLE value, speed in m/s. Maximum mean speed in the proximity zone that prevent the split. `MOTIONSPLIT` will split only if there is a full stop during the given time and radius, and if the mean speed in the proximity zone is less than this parameter.\n- **stopped.split**: BOOLEAN value. If true, `MOTIONSPLIT` also splits between stopped and moving sequences. If defined, the split type label will be \"stopped\" or \"moving\".\n- **label.stopped.time**: STRING value. If defined, `MOTIONSPLIT` will add an extra label on each split that contains the time in stopped state. If the split source is not a stop detection, this label won't be set.\n- **label.split.number**: STRING value. If defined, `MOTIONSPLIT` will add an extra label on each split that contains the split number, starting from 1.\n- **label.split.type**: STRING value. If defined, `MOTIONSPLIT` will add an extra label that contains the split reason. It could be \"timesplit\", \"distancesplit\", \"end\", \"stopped\" or \"moving\". \n\n`MOTIONSPLIT` split type priorities:\n- If stopped.min.time and stopped.max.radius are set, the stop detection has the first priority.\n- If `MOTIONSPLIT` does not detect a stopped state, it looks for a distance split.\n- If `MOTIONSPLIT` does not detect a stopped state or a distance split, it looks for a time split.\n\n\n@param `parameters` List of splitting parameters.

It is somehow similar to the [`REDUCE`](/doc/REDUCE) framework in the sense that everything you can do with `REDUCE` can be done with `APPLY`, but `APPLY` is more flexible and goes way beyond what `REDUCE` can due. The flexibility of `APPLY` comes with a greater complexity and thus both frameworks exist.\n\n`APPLY` operates on multiple lists of Geo Time Series™, `L1` ... `Ln`. The first phase of `APPLY` will partition each of those lists in equivalence classes by inspecting the values of the specified labels. If one of the lists is a singleton (*i.e.* contains a single Geo Time Series™), then it will be included in all equivalence classes, regardless of the values of its labels. If you wish to override this behaviour, simply duplicate the GTS in the list so it is no longer a singleton.\n\nThe second phase of `APPLY` will execute the operation for each equivalence class. The execution will apply the operation to `n` parameters, tick by tick, where the `i`th parameter is a list of lists of `timestamp`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `elevation` and `value`, one for each GTS from the list `Li` which is in the current equivalence class, in the order in which they appear in `Li`.

If you use a [metaset](/doc/METASET) and also specify a token, the token included in the metaset will be ignored.\n\n### Concerned Geo Time Series\n`FETCH` selects Geo Time Series according to:\n+ The `selectors` parameter, which is a list of selector.\n+ If `selectors` is not found, `FETCH` uses the `selector` parameter which is a single selector.\n+ If `selector` is not found, `FETCH`  uses both `class` and `labels` parameters.  \n\n### Time window\n`FETCH`  begins from the newest value and stop when the oldest value is collected. Thus, `end` must be defined in your request and defines the newest included value in your time window. If `end` is anterior to your oldest value, the result will be empty (no Geo Time Series). The span of the time window ending at `end` is then defined according to:\n+ The `timespan` parameter.\n+ If `timespan` is not defined, `FETCH` collects a maximum of `count` point.\n+ If `count` is not defined, `FETCH` determines `timespan` with `start`. If `start` is more recent than `end`, `end` and `start` are permuted internally. Be careful, this means `end` is included but  **`start` is excluded from the time window**.\n\n### Boundaries\nSince version 2.3.0, you can define *boundaries* around the requested data. When fetching data based on a time range, both a *pre* and *post* boundaries can be specified. When fetching by count, only a *pre* boundary can be requested.\nBoundaries are a number of datapoints which are either before (*pre* boundary) or after (*post* boundary) the fetched data. Fetching boundaries is very useful when storing only the changes of values as they enable you to always fetch datapoints even if the requested time range does not contain any. They can also be used to fetch the first `N` datapoints after a given timestamp.\nNote that fetching *post* boundaries is less efficient than fetching the requested range or a *pre* boundary as the data has to be scanned in reverse order which has an impact on I/Os and ultimately on performance.\n\nIf you want to read only Geo Time Series attributes or labels, using [FIND](/doc/FIND) is more efficient than fetching the last value.\n\n@param `token` Read token to use to fetch the data.\n\n@param `class` Selector for the GTS classes.

more measurements are added. Some series have very regular measurements,\nothers more sporadic ones. But when it comes to manipulating the data, it might be handy to be able to impose some kind of regularity to measurements.\nThis is exactly what the [`BUCKETIZE`](/doc/BUCKETIZE) framework does, it provides the tooling for putting the data of a Geo Time Series™ into regularly spaced\n**buckets**.\n\nA **bucket** is a time interval which spans a certain number of time units called the **bucketspan**, ending at a tick called the **lastbucket**.\n\nAs an example, the bucket spanning 10 time units and ending at time units 20 will contain all measurements taken at the following times:\n\n20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11\n\nthe previous bucket with the same bucketspan ends at 10 and covers ticks 10 down to 1. The next bucket ends at 30 and covers ticks 21 to 30.\n\nA bucketized Geo Time Series™ is characterized by its **bucketspan**, its **bucketcount** and the **lastbucket**.\nA bucketized Geo Time Series™ has at most one measurement per bucket, there might be buckets with no measurements.\n\nThe `BUCKETIZE` framework is used to convert a non bucketized Geo Time Series™ into a bucketized one. The bucketization process collects\nthe measurements of the original geo time series which fall in each bucket and apply a bucketizer function on those data, thus leading to at most a\nsingle measurement for each bucket.\n\nThe `BUCKETIZE` framework comes with a number of bucketizer which implement very common aggregation functions such as SUM, MIN, MAX, MEAN, etc.\n\nA macro can be used instead of the bucketizer argument. In that case, in each bucket the measurements are collected as a sub Geo Time Series™ which is taken as parameter by the macro.\nThis macro must then push onto the stack its result (see description in signature description below).\n\nIf the bucketizer argument is NULL, then BUCKETIZE do not create any new Geo Time Series™ but instead sets the lastbucket, bucketspan and bucketcount of its inputs without processing their data.\n\n\n@param `bucketcount` Number of buckets of the bucketized geo time series. If this value is set to 0, the number of buckets will be computed so the first value of the geo time series is at the beginning of the first bucket.\n\n@param `bucketspan` Width in time units of each bucket. If `bucketspan` is 0 but `bucketcount` is set, WarpScript will compute `bucketspan` so `bucketcount` buckets cover the complete set of values from firsttick to lasttick. If this value is set to -1, the number of buckets is computed so the first tick is towards the end of the first bucket.\n\n@param `lastbucket` Specifies the timestamp in time units since the Unix Epoch of the end of the most recent bucket. If you set this value to 0, this timestamp will be computed automatically so it covers the most recent value of the geo time series and falls on a `bucketspan` boundary.\n\n@param `gts` One or more Geo Time Series™\n\n@param `gtsList` One or more lists of Geo Time Series™\n\n@param `bucketizer` Bucketizer function to apply\n\n@param `macro` Macro to apply.
