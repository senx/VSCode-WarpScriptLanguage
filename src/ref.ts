Warp 10 platform grow over time as more measurements are added. Some series have very regular measurements,\nothers more sporadic ones. But when it comes to manipulating the data, it might be handy to be able to impose some kind of regularity to measurements.\nThis is exactly what the [`BUCKETIZE`](/doc/BUCKETIZE) framework does, it provides the tooling for putting the data of a Geo Time Series™ into regularly spaced\n**buckets**.\n\nA **bucket** is a time interval which spans a certain number of time units called the **bucketspan**, ending at a tick called the **lastbucket**.\n\nAs an example, the bucket spanning 10 time units and ending at time units 20 will contain all measurements taken at the following times:\n\n20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11\n\nthe previous bucket with the same bucketspan ends at 10 and covers ticks 10 down to 1.

The bucketization process collects\nthe measurements of the original geo time series which fall in each bucket and apply a bucketizer function on those data, thus leading to at most a\nsingle measurement for each bucket.\n\nThe `BUCKETIZE` framework comes with a number of bucketizer which implement very common aggregation functions such as SUM, MIN, MAX, MEAN, etc.\n\n\n\n@param `bucketcount` Number of buckets of the bucketized geo time series. If this value is set to 0, the number of buckets will be computed so the first value of the geo time series is at the beginning of the first bucket. If this value is set to -1, the number of buckets is computed so the first tick is towards the end of the first bucket.\n\n@param `bucketspan` Width in time units of each bucket. If `bucketspan` is 0 but `bucketcount` is set, WarpScript will compute `bucketspan` so `bucketcount` buckets cover the complete set of values from firsttick to lasttick\n\n@param `lastbucket` Specifies the timestamp in time units since the Unix Epoch of the end of the most recent bucket.
