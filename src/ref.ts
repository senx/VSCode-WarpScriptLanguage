The flexibility of `APPLY` comes with a greater complexity and thus both frameworks exist.\n\n`APPLY` operates on multiple lists of Geo Time Series™, `L1` ... `Ln`. The first phase of `APPLY` will partition each of those lists in equivalence classes by inspecting the values of the specified labels. If one of the lists is a singleton (*i.e.* contains a single Geo Time Series™), then it will be included in all equivalence classes, regardless of the values of its labels. If you wish to override this behaviour, simply duplicate the GTS in the list so it is no longer a singleton.\n\nThe second phase of `APPLY` will execute the operation for each equivalence class.

Some series have very regular measurements,\nothers more sporadic ones. But when it comes to manipulating the data, it might be handy to be able to impose some kind of regularity to measurements.\nThis is exactly what the [`BUCKETIZE`](/doc/BUCKETIZE) framework does, it provides the tooling for putting the data of a Geo Time Series™ into regularly spaced\n**buckets**.\n\nA **bucket** is a time interval which spans a certain number of time units called the **bucketspan**, ending at a tick called the **lastbucket**.\n\nAs an example, the bucket spanning 10 time units and ending at time units 20 will contain all measurements taken at the following times:\n\n20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11\n\nthe previous bucket with the same bucketspan ends at 10 and covers ticks 10 down to 1. The next bucket ends at 30 and covers ticks 21 to 30.\n\nA bucketized Geo Time Series™ is characterized by its **bucketspan**, its **bucketcount** and the **lastbucket**.\nA bucketized Geo Time Series™ has at most one measurement per bucket, there might be buckets with no measurements.\n\nThe `BUCKETIZE` framework is used to convert a non bucketized Geo Time Series™ into a bucketized one. The bucketization process collects\nthe measurements of the original geo time series which fall in each bucket and apply a bucketizer function on those data, thus leading to at most a\nsingle measurement for each bucket.\n\nThe `BUCKETIZE` framework comes with a number of bucketizer which implement very common aggregation functions such as SUM, MIN, MAX, MEAN, etc.\n\nA macro can be used instead of the bucketizer argument. In that case, in each bucket the measurements are collected as a sub Geo Time Series™ which is taken as parameter by the macro.\nThis macro must then push onto the stack its result (see description in signature description below).\n\nIf the bucketizer argument is NULL, then BUCKETIZE do not create any new Geo Time Series™ but instead sets the lastbucket, bucketspan and bucketcount of its inputs without processing their data.\n\n\n@param `bucketcount` Number of buckets of the bucketized geo time series. If this value is set to 0, the number of buckets will be computed so the first value of the geo time series is at the beginning of the first bucket.\n\n@param `bucketspan` Width in time units of each bucket. If `bucketspan` is 0 but `bucketcount` is set, WarpScript will compute `bucketspan` so `bucketcount` buckets cover the complete set of values from firsttick to lasttick. If this value is set to -1, the number of buckets is computed so the first tick is towards the end of the first bucket.\n\n@param `lastbucket` Specifies the timestamp in time units since the Unix Epoch of the end of the most recent bucket. If you set this value to 0, this timestamp will be computed automatically so it covers the most recent value of the geo time series and falls on a `bucketspan` boundary.\n\n@param `gts` One or more Geo Time Series™\n\n@param `gtsList` One or more lists of Geo Time Series™\n\n@param `bucketizer` Bucketizer function to apply\n\n@param `macro` Macro to apply.

However, complex bucketdurations that can be non-positive from some ticks are not allowed.\n\nIn the result, the tick of each bucket is its index, which is equal to the number of buckets that are ended since Unix Epoch. In particular, the tick of the bucket that contains Unix Epoch is always 0. The resulting GTS is considered bucketized for further operations. Then, the function UNBUCKETIZE.CALENDAR can be used to replace bucket indices with their timestamp end boundaries.\n\nThis function answers the limitation of BUCKETIZE to regular buckets. For instance, BUCKETIZE.CALENDAR can be used with a duration of one month (`P1M`) or one year (`P1Y`).\n\nThe delta between Unix Epoch and the first timestamp of bucket 0th is called the bucketoffset.

Those are defining the **read access rights**, the **concerned Geo Time Series** and the **time window**. Other parameters in the map input are optional. \n\nThe list input is here to keep backward compatibility with old WarpScripts. The map input allows a great flexibility, as described below.\n\n### Access rights\nA valid read token is needed to read data with fetch. If you use a [metaset](/doc/METASET) and also specify a token, the token included in the metaset will be ignored.\n\n### Concerned Geo Time Series\n`FETCH` selects Geo Time Series according to:\n+ The `selectors` parameter, which is a list of selector.\n+ If `selectors` is not found, `FETCH` uses the `selector` parameter which is a single selector.\n+ If `selector` is not found, `FETCH`  uses both `class` and `labels` parameters.  \n\n### Time window\n`FETCH`  begins from the newest value and stop when the oldest value is collected. Thus, `end` must be defined in your request and defines the newest included value in your time window. If `end` is anterior to your oldest value, the result will be empty (no Geo Time Series). The span of the time window ending at `end` is then defined according to:\n+ The `timespan` parameter.\n+ If `timespan` is not defined, `FETCH` collects a maximum of `count` point.\n+ If `count` is not defined, `FETCH` determines `timespan` with `start`. If `start` is more recent than `end`, `end` and `start` are permuted internally. Be careful, this means `end` is included but  **`start` is excluded from the time window**.\n\n### Boundaries\nSince version 2.3.0, you can define *boundaries* around the requested data. When fetching data based on a time range, both a *pre* and *post* boundaries can be specified. When fetching by count, only a *pre* boundary can be requested.\nBoundaries are a number of datapoints which are either before (*pre* boundary) or after (*post* boundary) the fetched data. Fetching boundaries is very useful when storing only the changes of values as they enable you to always fetch datapoints even if the requested time range does not contain any. They can also be used to fetch the first `N` datapoints after a given timestamp.\nNote that fetching *post* boundaries is less efficient than fetching the requested range or a *pre* boundary as the data has to be scanned in reverse order which has an impact on I/Os and ultimately on performance.\n\n### Sampling options\n+ Since version 2.3.0, you can randomly sample points with the `sample` parameter. If `sample` equals 0.1, `FETCH` will randomly return one point out of ten. This implementation is the fastest way to resample data.\n+ Since version 2.3.0, you can `skip` the N newest datapoints in the time window specified.\n\n### Query without looking into directory\nThe fetch time to read one gts among millions of gts recorded with the same classname, the same application and the same owner can take time. Use the `gts` parameter to select if you exactly know the classname and all the labels.\n\nIf you want to read only Geo Time Series attributes or labels, using [FIND](/doc/FIND) is more efficient than fetching the last value.\n\n@param `token` Read token to use to fetch the data.\n\n@param `class` Selector for the GTS classes. Can either be an exact match or a regular expression (the value should then start with a *~*).\n\n@param `labels` Map of labels selectors. The key is the label name, the value a selector which can be an exact match or a regular expression (the value should then start with a *~*).\n\n@param `start` Oldest timestamp to consider when fetching datapoints. In platform time unit or [ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601).\n\n@param `end` Newest timestamp to consider when fetching datapoints. In platform time unit or [ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601).\n\n@param `data` List of fetched Geo Time Series™.\n\n@param `selector` A Geo Time Series™ selector with the syntax `class{labels}` where `class` is an exact match or a regular expression starting with *~* and `labels` a comma separated list of labels selector of the form `name=exact` or `name~regexp`. Names and values must be percent URL encoded if needed.\n\n@param `selectors` A list of GTS selectors, each with a syntax identical to that of 'selector'.\n\n@param `metaset` A set of Geo Time Series™ produced by the [`METASET`](/doc/METASET) function.\n\n@param `type` Name of type to force for the GTS, either LONG, DOUBLE, BOOLEAN or STRING.\n\n@param `typeattr` Name of label to use for storing the GTS type. This option is incompatible with 'type', when set values of different types are ventilated in separate GTS with the same set of class and labels and an additional *type* label of the given name.\n\n@param `timespan` Depth to consider when fetching the datapoints. If the value is positive then it is interpreted as a duration in time units, if it is negative then as the maximum number of datapoints to fetch. If negative, incompatible with 'count'.\n\n@param `count` Maximum number of datapoints to fetch for each GTS. Incompatible with negative 'timespan'.\n\n@param `extra` List of extraneous classes to fetch. For each GTS matching the selection criteria, GTS with those extra class names will be fetched too (with the *exact* same set of labels).\n\n@param `active.after` Timestamp after which a GTS must have been updated to be considered for the fetch. This parameter is only considered when activity tracking is enabled.\n\n@param `quiet.after` Timestamp after which a GTS must not have been updated to be considered for the fetch. This parameter is only considered when activity tracking is enabled.\n\n@param `gts` Explicit list of Geo Time Series™ to fetch. The class and labels will be used as is and not serve as selectors.\n\n@param `boundary` Number of datapoints to include in both *pre* and *post* boundaries.\n\n@param `boundary.pre` Number of datapoints in the *pre* boundary.\n\n@param `boundary.post` Number of datapoints in the *post* boundary.\n\n@param `sampling.ratio` A probability between 0 (excluded, no datapoints returned) and 1.0 (all datapoints returned).
